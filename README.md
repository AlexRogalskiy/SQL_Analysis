	- In this project I took dummy data of the start-up and analyzed it to inference
	  various trends in it's development. The analysis was done with MySQL and it's 
	  workbench

	- There are 2 chunks of the analysis which are related to older and newer time periods

	- For more precise notes in regard to analysis you can go to the files themselves



<h4>Intepretation of the first analysis</h4>
	
	- Sessions are growing over time as well as orders
	- Brand sessions are picking up => brand awarness is rising
	- There is a prevalence of desktop sessions & orders over mobile ones
	- As organic search & direct-in one is growing it's possible to say that the cost of customer acquisition is falling
	- Session to order CVR is growing
	- New landing page enabled the overall increase of the orders
	- Custom homepage increased Conversion funnel
	- New billing page also managed to bring more profit
